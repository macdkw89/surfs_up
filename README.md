Key Takeways: 
- The mean temperatures for June and December are roughly only 4 degrees different, which means the weather relatively consistent year round.
- The max temperature for December is only 2 degrees less than June, which means there are still plenty of 'hot' days in December where people will be more likely to buy ice cream.
- The primary difference between June and December weather is that December fluctuates more towards the lower end of the temperature spectrum, but still has a similar "max" temperature.
